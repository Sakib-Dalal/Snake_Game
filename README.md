# Snake Game

This Snake Game is a simple implementation in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail.

## Game Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Move the snake upwards
- **Down Arrow**: Move the snake downwards
- **Left Arrow**: Move the snake to the left
- **Right Arrow**: Move the snake to the right

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following link:
   [git@github.com:Sakib-Dalal/Snake_Game.git](git@github.com:Sakib-Dalal/Snake_Game.git)

2. Run the `main.py` file using a Python interpreter.

3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat the food to score points.

4. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail.

5. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, and the final score is displayed.
